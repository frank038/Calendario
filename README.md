Version 1.0

MD5SUM calendario.py_20200928.tar.gz: 6374639721d4740051d53ad6882c0d07

This program is free to use and modify for everyone.

Calendario stores all the events in a standard ics file.
Because of the huge specs of this format, only the necessary fields will be used:
- Summary
- Location
- Destription
- Dtstart (starting date and time)
- Dtend (ending date and time).

The button bar from left:
- choose a month (click on the name to go to today)
- choose a year (click on the year to to to today)
- add a new appointment
- save the calendar
- exit the program.

Calendario tends to be a quite complite program in its semplicity.

Date limitation: if an event is longer than one day, it will appear only in the day it starts.
