# Calendario
A simply program where to store appointments.
Version 1.0

This program is free to use and modify for everyone.

Calendario stores all the events in a standard ics file.
Because of the huge specs of this format, only the necessary fields will be used:
- Summary
- Location
- Destription
- Dtstart (starting date and time)
- Dtend (ending date and time).
